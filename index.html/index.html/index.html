    <p>Ashenda is an annual Tigrayan festival that celebrates women and girls. It is believed to have originated in the
        Axum region of Tigray, with scholars estimating it began around 400 AD. The festival takes place in August and
        is mainly celebrated in Mekelle, where the largest Ashenda festival occurs. Only women participate in the
        celebration, while men often play the roles of gift-givers and, in some cases, protectors from potential
        harassment. During the festival, younger girls travel door to door, singing Ashenda songs and receiving gifts
        like money and traditional food made for the occasion. Ashenda follows two weeks of Filseta, during which people
        fast or abstain from eating during the day, and both Filseta and Ashenda honor the Virgin Mary.</p>
